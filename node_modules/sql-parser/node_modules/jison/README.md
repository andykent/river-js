An API for creating parsers in JavaScript
-----------------------------------------

Jison generates bottom-up parsers in JavaScript. Its API is similar to Bison's, hence the name. It supports many of Bison's major features, plus some of its own. If you are new to parser generators such as Bison, and Context-free Grammars in general, a [good introduction][1] is found in the Bison manual. If you already know Bison, Jison should be easy to pickup.

A brief warning before proceeding: **the API is ridiculously unstable** right now. The goal is to mirror Bison where it makes sense, but we're not even there yet. Also, optimization has not been a main focus as of yet.

Briefly, Jison takes a JSON encoded grammar specification and outputs a JavaScript file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar specification. You can then use the generated script to parse inputs and accept, reject, or perform actions based on the input.

Installation
------------
Jison can be installed for [Node](http://nodejs.org) using [`npm`](http://github.com/isaacs/npm/)

Using npm:

    npm install jison -g

Usage from the command line
-----------------------

Clone the github repository for examples:

    git clone git://github.com/zaach/jison.git
    cd jison/examples

Now you're ready to generate some parsers:

    jison calculator.jison

This will generate `calculator.js` in your current working directory. This file can be used to parse an input file, like so:

    echo "2^32 / 1024" > testcalc
    node calculator.js testcalc

This will print out `4194304`.

Usage from a CommonJS module
--------------------------

You can generate parsers programatically from JavaScript as well. Assuming Jison is in your commonjs environment's load path:

    // mygenerator.js
    var Parser = require("jison").Parser;
    
    // a grammar in JSON
    var grammar = {
        "lex": {
            "rules": [
               ["\\s+", "/* skip whitespace */"],
               ["[a-f0-9]+", "return 'HEX';"]
            ]
        },
    
        "bnf": {
            "hex_strings" :[ "hex_strings HEX",
                             "HEX" ]
        }
    };
    
    var parser = new Parser(grammar);
    
    // generate source, ready to be written to disk
    var parserSource = parser.generate();
    
    // you can also use the parser directly from memory
    
    // returns true
    parser.parse("adfe34bc e82a");
    
    // throws lexical error
    parser.parse("adfe34bc zxg");
